About application
-----------------

Designed for comperhensive comparison of two selected directories.
Files are compared by: existence, modification date, size and
contents. Two directories are scanned asynchroneously,
which can save time when directories are on two different 
physical discs

I use it to compare backup drive with one containing original
contents. Option of copying files from inside the app is planned.
 
This is a open source application that uses several closed
source components.
